## Original Todo
MVP of speech trainer app

## Description
Build a playful speech trainer web application designed for children ages 5-10 to practice specific speech sounds. The app will have two inputs: a colorful dropdown menu for selecting speech sounds (S, T, P, K, W) and a text field for entering a fun theme (max 50 characters). Based on these inputs, the app will display 10 themed words containing the selected speech sound as vibrant, interactive cards with kid-friendly graphics and animations. Children can navigate between word cards using large, easy-to-tap previous/next buttons. Each combination of speech sound and theme will generate a different static list of age-appropriate practice words. The entire interface will feature bright colors, playful fonts, and engaging visual feedback to keep young learners motivated.

## Implementation Plan
Build the interactive UI and word generation system for the kids' speech trainer app:

- [x] Create playful HTML structure with dropdown for speech sounds (S, T, P, K, W) and theme input field (src/index.html)
- [x] Style the app with bright, kid-friendly colors and large touch targets using Tailwind CSS (src/styles.css)
- [x] Implement dropdown and theme input handlers with 50-character limit validation (src/index.ts:20-50)
- [x] Create word data structure with themed word lists for each speech sound (src/index.ts:60-200)
- [x] Build card navigation system with previous/next buttons and card counter display (src/index.ts:210-280)
- [x] Add smooth card transitions and playful animations for better engagement (src/index.ts:290-320)
- [x] Implement keyboard navigation support for accessibility (src/index.ts:330-350)
- [x] Test full user flow: select sound → enter theme → view cards → navigate words
- [x] User test: Verify the interface is intuitive for kids and all navigation works smoothly
